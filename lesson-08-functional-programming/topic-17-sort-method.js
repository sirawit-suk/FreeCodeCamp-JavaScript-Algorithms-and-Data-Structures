 conclusion
 a is a second
 b is a first

 loop#2 = (3, 2) from [1,(b=2,a=3),4]
 loop#3 = (4, 3) from [1,2,(b=3, a=4)] //NO , IT DEPEND!, SEE AT THE END

 result if 1 (mean already sorted, a will be behind b already)
 result if -1 (mean not sorted yet, b will come first and a is a second (swap))
 result if 0 (mean equal num, continue and preserve);

  "I've just had a look at the WebKit (Chrome, Safari â€¦) source. Depending on the type of array, different sort methods are used:"

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57763205/what-is-array-prototype-sort-time-complexity
  "Firefox uses merge sort. Chrome, as of version 70, uses a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort called Timsort."

  https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-time-complexity-of-JavaScripts-sort-function
  "Note: personally I prefer HeapSort. I tested a recursive HeapSort implementation against Array.prototype.sort() on a 10M array. While HeapSort took 10 seconds, sort() took almost 3 minutes."

  my note: We can't tell, it's depend, just to know how this Array.sort() work in high level and return.
  if want to optimize to be better for time and space complexity, may write own sort function.
